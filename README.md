## What is Seedance 2.5?

**Seedance 2.5** is ByteDance's latest AI video generation model, built on the Seed video foundation. It is a significant upgrade over Seedance 2.0, with a focus on:

- **Multi-shot storytelling** — generate longer, cinematically coherent narratives from a single prompt
- **Character & brand consistency** — maintain the same face, clothing, and style across all shots
- **Director-grade camera control** — precise rack focus, crane shots, whip pans, and more
- **Native audio synchronization** — tighter lip-sync and sound design baked in at generation time
- **Better physics & motion stability** — realistic fluid dynamics, cloth simulation, and crowd motion

Seedance 2.5 accepts **text, images, video clips, and audio** as input and outputs **MP4 video with synchronized audio**.

    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < timeout:
        res = requests.get(
            f"https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/status/{request_id}",
            headers={"x-api-key": api_key}
        ).json()
        if res["status"] == "completed":
            return res["outputs"][0]
        elif res["status"] == "failed":
            raise Exception(res.get("error", "Generation failed"))
        time.sleep(poll_interval)

## Prompt Engineering Guide

### The 6-Step Formula

Structure your prompts using this formula for best results. **The first 20–30 words carry the most weight** — Seedance locks in the subject and core action from the opening.

```
[SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [ENVIRONMENT] + [CAMERA] + [STYLE] + [CONSTRAINTS]
```

**Target length: 60–100 words.**

**Example:**
```
A young chef (subject) carefully plates a dish with tweezers (action) 
in a Michelin-star restaurant kitchen at midnight (environment), 
close-up rack focus from hands to face (camera), 
warm tungsten lighting, cinematic 35mm film grain (style), 
no jump cuts, maintain consistent kitchen background (constraints).
```

---

### Camera Movement Vocabulary

Use these exact terms in your prompts for precise camera control:

| Movement | Prompt Keyword |
|---|---|
| Move toward subject | `slow push in` / `dolly in` |
| Move away from subject | `pull back` / `dolly out` |
| Horizontal slide | `tracking shot left/right` |
| Vertical rise | `crane up` / `boom up` |
| Follow subject | `steadicam follow shot` |
| Rotate around subject | `orbit shot` / `360 arc` |
| Quick pan | `whip pan left/right` |
| Lock still | `static shot` / `locked off camera` |
| Overhead | `bird's eye view` / `top-down` |
| Low angle | `worm's eye view` / `low angle` |
| Shaky, urgent | `handheld camera` |
| Smooth glide | `gimbal shot` |
| Background blur | `rack focus to subject` |

---

### Lighting Keywords

> **Lighting descriptions have the biggest single impact on video quality.** One strong lighting keyword beats ten adjectives.

| Look | Keyword |
|---|---|
| Film-quality warmth | `golden hour cinematography` |
| Night scene | `tungsten practical lighting` |
| Drama / mystery | `chiaroscuro lighting` |
| Studio clean | `soft box three-point lighting` |
| Neon / cyberpunk | `neon-drenched night scene` |
| Documentary | `natural available light` |
| Horror | `harsh under-lighting` |
| Beauty / fashion | `butterfly lighting` |
| Outdoor overcast | `diffused cloudy daylight` |

---

### Multimodal Reference Syntax

When passing images, videos, or audio alongside your prompt, reference them with `@Tags`:

```
@Image1 — reference a still image input
@Image2 — second image input
@Video1 — reference a video clip input
@Audio1 — reference an audio file input
```

**Example multimodal prompt:**
```
@Image1 is the main character. @Audio1 is the background score. 
She walks through a neon-lit Tokyo alley at night, camera tracking 
alongside her, cinematic depth of field, rain-soaked streets reflecting 
the neon signs, sync the footsteps to @Audio1.
```

---

### Shot Script Format (Advanced)

For multi-shot videos, use timecodes to control pacing:

```
[0:00–0:03] WIDE SHOT — Aerial view of a volcanic island at sunrise, slow push in.
[0:03–0:08] MEDIUM SHOT — A researcher emerges from a tent, looks toward the volcano, rack focus to her face.
[0:08–0:15] CLOSE-UP — Her eyes reflecting the distant glow, golden hour light, handheld slight tremor.
Style: BBC Planet Earth, 4K cinematic, natural sound design.
```

```

---

### Multi-Shot Sequences

```
[0:00–0:04] AERIAL WIDE — Drone shot descending toward a mountain summit at dawn.
[0:04–0:09] MEDIUM — A hiker reaches the peak, arms raised, facing away from camera.
[0:09–0:15] CLOSE-UP — Her face turns to us, wind in her hair, tears in her eyes, sunrise light.
Style: Inspirational brand film, Hans Zimmer-style score, no dialogue.
```

---

## Advanced Workflows

### Character Consistency Across Shots

1. Start with a clear reference image of your character (`@Image1`)
2. Describe physical attributes explicitly in every shot: *"same woman, mid-30s, red dress, dark curly hair"*
3. Lock the lighting style in your opening prompt and repeat it per shot
4. Use `maintain character appearance throughout` as a trailing constraint

### Brand-Safe Style Fusion

```
[Brand palette: navy blue, warm gold, clean white]
A product (@Image1) sits on a marble surface, soft natural window light, 
navy and gold color grade, luxury minimal aesthetic, slow push in, 
brand colors maintained throughout, no text overlays.
```

### AI Dance / Motion Transfer

```
@Image1 is a person standing in a neutral pose. Apply full-body dance 
choreography — contemporary hip-hop style, maintain their exact face and 
clothing, smooth 24fps motion, rhythmic bass-driven audio sync, 9:16 vertical.
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Front-load the subject and action** — the first 20–30 words determine the output more than anything else
- **One lighting keyword > ten adjectives** — `golden hour cinematography` beats `warm, beautiful, glowing, soft, rich, vibrant...`
- **Be explicit about what NOT to do** — `no jump cuts`, `no text overlays`, `no camera shake` prevent common artifacts
- **Use film/director references as style anchors** — `Wes Anderson symmetry`, `Roger Deakins lighting`, `Wong Kar-wai color grade`
- **For 9:16 vertical**, explicitly state it and design composition for mobile framing (subjects centered, headroom at top)
- **Iterate on lighting first** — if a generation looks flat, add or change the lighting keyword before anything else
- **Use seeds for reproducibility** — save the seed of a generation you like to iterate from the same base
